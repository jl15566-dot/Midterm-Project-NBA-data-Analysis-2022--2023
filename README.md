# Midterm-Project-NBA-data-Analysis-2022--2023

## Project Overview
This data analytics project conducts a comprehensive examination of Joel Embiid's 2022-23 MVP season, leveraging Python and statistical methods to evaluate whether his performance metrics justified the Most Valuable Player award.

## Research Question
Did Joel Embiid's statistical performance in the 2022-23 NBA season genuinely warrant the MVP honor, and how did his production compare to other elite candidates?

## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured three-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Preparation
- Web scraping of game-level data from Basketball-Reference
- Collection of league-wide player statistics
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas

### Phase 2: Individual Performance Analysis
- Basic and advanced statistical calculations (TS%, eFG%, Usage Rate)
- Monthly performance trends and consistency metrics
- Win-loss impact analysis and correlation studies

### Phase 3: Comparative Evaluation
- League ranking analysis across key categories
- Efficiency-volume comparisons with MVP candidates
- Radar chart visualization of multi-dimensional performance

## Key Findings
- **Scoring Dominance**: League-leading 33.1 PPG with elite efficiency (65.0% TS)
- **Consistent Excellence**: Demonstrated remarkable stability through rolling average analysis
- **Winning Impact**: Strong positive correlation between Embiid's efficiency and team success
- **Comparative Advantage**: Balanced statistical profile outperformed peers in critical categories

## Technologies Used
- Python, pandas, numpy (Data processing & analysis)
- matplotlib, seaborn (Data visualization)
- Web scraping
- Jupyter Notebook (Analysis environment)
